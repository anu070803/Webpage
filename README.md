# 🌐Web Application using JSP & Servlets

This project is a Java-based web application developed using JSP (JavaServer Pages) and Servlets. The application demonstrates the fundamental concepts of web development with Java, including request handling, session management, and dynamic content rendering.

It contains multiple interactive pages such as Home, About, Skills, Projects, Achievements, Education, and Welcome, along with a login and logout system implemented using Servlets. The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, ensuring a clean separation between business logic, presentation, and configuration.
